Unsplash is one of the best places to find quality images online. Over the years, I have used so much that I decided to contribute to the Unsplash by adding my photographs. Then I encounter the [photos section of Adem Ilter's website](https://ademilter.com/photos). I decided to add my own photos page. Let's start planning.

These are the steps we must follow one by one. This is not a tutorial we can complete in a short time. We must wait for the approval a couple of times.&#x20;

1. [Creating an Unsplash Account](https://unsplash.com/)
2. Submitting some photos and waiting for the publishing
3. [Creating an application on Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers) to get an API Key. [You can check the docs here.](https://unsplash.com/documentation)
4. Creating server actions
5. Fetching and displaying the data

Let's define the Unsplah API Key in the env.development file. We should add this env.production file or environment variables inside Vercel or other platforms.

```ts {4} showLineNumbers
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY= Get the key from unsplah developer's application page. This will be the Access Key.
```

Now we can create our server actions.

Create a file whose name is **actions** inside the root folder. Then you can create **unsplash.ts** inside the actions

```tsx {4} showLineNumbers
async function getData(url: string) {
  const res = await fetch(url, {
    method: "GET",
  });
  if (!res.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Error fetching data from Unsplash: ${res.statusText}`);
  }
  return await res.json();
}

export async function getStats() {
  const base_url = "https://api.unsplash.com/users/haskup/statistics";
  const url = `${base_url}?client_id=${process.env.UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY}`;
  return await getData(url);
}

export async function getPhotos(per_page = 50) {
  const base_url = "https://api.unsplash.com/users/haskup/photos";
  const url = `${base_url}?per_page=${per_page}&client_id=${process.env.UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY}`;
  return await getData(url);
}
```

I want to display the statistics and photos like in the example website. These functions are enough for these purposes. If you widen the example you can check the documentation.

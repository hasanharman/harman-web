<VinylRecord />

Last weekend, while scrolling through Twitter, I came across a video of a spinning movie CD. (Original post: https://x.com/matthischmid/status/1858196401311654116) Coincidentally, I was listening to Linkin Parkâ€™s latest album at the time. Linkin Park holds a special place in my heartâ€”they were the first band I ever listened to in a foreign language, and Iâ€™ve been a fan since I was seven.

I still feel a pang of sadness whenever I think of Chester ðŸ’”, but Iâ€™m also grateful that Emily continues to carry the torch. Their music has always been a source of inspiration for me.

Anyway, back to the topic! Inspired by that CD animation, I decided to create a spinning vinyl record component in React using **Framer Motion**. Letâ€™s build it together!

### Getting Started

This will be a simple component, so weâ€™ll only need to install one package.

```js
npm i framer-motion
```

1. Create a new file in the `components` folder and name it `vinyl-record.tsx`.
2. Copy the code below into your new file.

```tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from "framer-motion";
import Image from "next/image";

const DiscVariants = {
  hidden: {
    top: "-10%",
    x: "-50%",
    opacity: 0.9,
  },
  visible: {
    top: "-50%",
    x: "-50%",
    opacity: 1,
  },
};

const CoverVariants = {
  initial: { scale: 1 },
  hover: {
    scale: 1.05,
    transition: {
      type: "spring",
      stiffness: 300,
      damping: 30,
    },
  },
};

export default function VinylRecord() {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-[80vh] bg-gray-100 p-4">
      <div className="relative w-64 h-64">
        <AnimatePresence>
          {/* Vinyl Disc */}
          <motion.div
            className="absolute left-1/2 rounded-full z-0 w-60 h-60"
            variants={DiscVariants}
            initial="hidden"
            animate={isHovered ? "visible" : "hidden"}
            transition={{
              type: "spring",
              stiffness: 300,
              damping: 30,
            }}
            style={{
              background:
                "radial-gradient(circle at center, #0a0a0a 0%, #000000 80%)",
              boxShadow: "inset 0 0 10px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)",
            }}
          >
            {/* Grooves Pattern */}
            <div
              className="absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 w-1/2 h-1/2 rounded-full"
              style={{
                background:
                  "repeating-radial-gradient(circle at center, #333 0, #333 1px, transparent 1px, transparent 4px)",
              }}
            />
            {/* Center Label */}
            <div className="absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 w-1/4 h-1/4 bg-gray-400 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center">
              <motion.div
                className="w-1/3 h-1/3 bg-white rounded-full"
                animate={{ rotate: isHovered ? 360 : 0 }}
                transition={{
                  duration: 3,
                  ease: "linear",
                  repeat: Infinity,
                }}
              />
            </div>
          </motion.div>
        </AnimatePresence>

        {/* Record Cover */}
        <motion.div
          className="relative w-full h-full rounded shadow-xl z-10 overflow-hidden"
          variants={CoverVariants}
          initial="initial"
          whileHover="hover"
          onMouseEnter={() => setIsHovered(true)}
          onMouseLeave={() => setIsHovered(false)}
        >
          <Image
            src="https://linkinpedia.com/w/images/thumb/f/fe/Album-From_Zero.png/800px-Album-From_Zero.png"
            alt="Album Cover"
            fill
            sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px"
            className="object-cover"
            priority
          />
        </motion.div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Thatâ€™s it! You can customize the size, animations, and image to match your preferences.
